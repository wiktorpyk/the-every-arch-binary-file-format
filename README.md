# Multi-Architecture Binary Bundler

An example of combining binaries compiled for different architectures (e.g., x86_64, ARM, RISC-V) into a single portable binary (running directly could be implemented easily).

## Benefits
- build system agnostic
- easy extraction/conversion to target architecture
